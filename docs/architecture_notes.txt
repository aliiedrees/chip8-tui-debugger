ARCHITECTURE NOTES
==================

1. MEMORY MAPPING
   - CHIP-8 has 4KB memory.
   - 0x000 to 0x1FF is reserved for interpreter (we can use this for font data).
   - 0x200 starts the program (ROM).

2. RISC-V PARALLELS
   - The CHIP-8 "Delay Timer" acts like a hardware interrupt counter.
   - V0-VF registers need to be unsigned (uint8_t).

3. TODO
   - Define the Fetch-Decode-Execute loop in main.cpp.
